# greedySnake
A game to improve programming skill.

My friend said that letâ€™s write a game and use AI to play it. It sounds fun to see who trained the model to play better. I just wanted to compare it with the classic snake. At first I planned to use tkinter to write, but later I found it more convenient to write with pygame. I remember when I was a student, I wrote it in C. I was running on a simulation platform at that time. I didn't expect to write another one in python after so many years. However, this is not as complete as the one written in C at the time. Some functions have not been added yet, and may be added slowly in the future.
